The `ggplot2` package provides many possibilities to visualize data and let you create visualizations from the ground. Moreover, there are plenty of `ggplot2` extensions packages that increase your possibilities and in this blog I concentrate on ten packages providing an additional geom. (1) I describe each visualization briefly. (2) I show an example graph. (3) I provide a minimal code snippet to recreate such a graph with implemented data. By relying on implemented data, there is no hassle of running many data preparation steps if you want to explore one of the packages on your own. Now, relax and get inspired by the many `ggplot2` authors and extensions.

## Alluvial

Alluvial Diagrams are a great way to visualize the flow of data. For example, I used official data from German School Departments to depict the change of school types (downward and upward mobility) within a given year. As the plot shows, most pupils change to a lower school type and in consequence downward mobility is larger in Germany.

```{r Fig_731, echo=FALSE, eval=T, purl=FALSE}
school_alluvial()
```

The `ggalluvial` package provides an alluvial plot as an `ggplot2` extension [@ggalluvial]. The `geom_stratum()` function adds the stratum lines to the plot and the `geom_alluvium()` function fills the strata with the observed values. The minimal code example shows how to create an alluvial plot with the `titanic` data. The data must be in a wide format to work with.

```{r, results='hide', fig.keep='none'}
#Minimal code example #####
library(ggplot2)
library(ggalluvial)
#A wide data format
titanic_wide_format <- data.frame(Titanic)

ggplot(data = titanic_wide_format,
       aes(axis1 = Class, axis2 = Sex, axis3 = Age, y = Freq)) +
  geom_alluvium(aes(fill = Survived)) +
  geom_stratum()

```

## Beeswarm plots

Scatter plots are awesome to visualize the relationship between two numerical variables. However, if you have a lot of data points, over-plotting can be a problem. A beeswarm plot is a great alternative to scatter plots, because it decreases over-plotting by adding vertical noise. It is a categorical scatter plot that shows the distribution of a numerical variable for each category. For example, the following plot depicts body mass for each species and sex of the `palmerpenguins` data [@palmerpenguins-2].

```{r Fig_732, eval=T, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
bees()
```

The `ggbeeswarm` package provides the `geom_quasirandom()` function to create a beeswarm plot [@ggbeeswarm]. The function adds a little bit of noise to the x-axis to avoid over-plotting. You can pick the `method` argument to control the distribution of the points. Example methoda are `quasirandom`, `pseudorandom`, or `smiley`.

```{r  results='hide', fig.keep='none'}
#Minimal code example #####
library(ggbeeswarm)

ggplot(penguins, aes(species, body_mass_g, 
                     color = sex)) + 
    geom_quasirandom()
```

## Choropleth maps

Create a choropleth map: a map that displays areas with different colors based on the observed value.



The example shows the US unemployment rates in 2009. Creating a choropleth map is a bit more complicated than other plots, because you need to match the data with the geographical areas.

The `ggplot2` package does not provide a function to create choropleth maps, but the `ggplot2` extension `ggplot2` provides the `geom_sf()` function to create such maps [@ggplot2]. The `sf` package is used to handle spatial data [@sf]. The minimal code example shows how to create a choropleth map with the `USArrests` data.


```{r Fig_733, echo=FALSE, eval=T, purl=FALSE}
map_plot()

```

In addition, the `ggmap` package helps to create maps [@ggmap; @ggmap2013], because we need to draw the shape of each area (e.g., country shape) first. The shape must be displayed by its longitude and latitude before we can fill the area or display numbers that describe the area. 


The minimal code does not need any additional package and shows an example from the `ggplot2` cheat sheet. If the corresponding geographical areas can be matched with the data, `geom_map()` draws the map and fills each area with the observed value.

```{r,  results='hide', fig.keep='none'}
#Minimal code example #####
#Source: This example comes from the ggplot2 cheat sheet!
map <- map_data("state")
data <- data.frame(murder = USArrests$Murder,
                   state = tolower(rownames(USArrests)))

ggplot(data, aes(fill = murder))+
  geom_map(aes(map_id = state), map = map)+
  expand_limits(x = map$long, y = map$lat)

```

## Dot-and-whisker plot

A dot-and-whisker plot is a plot that shows the point estimates and confidence intervals of regression coefficients. It is a useful tool for visualizing the uncertainty associated with regression estimates. In the example below, I just run an example analysis with the palmerpenguins data.


```{r Fig_7311, echo=FALSE, eval=T, purl=FALSE}
dot_plot()
```

The dotwhisker package creates dot-and-whisker plots. It allows users to customize the appearance of the plot by adjusting various parameters such as the color and size of the dots and whiskers. However, if you need to come up with a quick solution, the jtools package also implements convenient solutions.



```{r, results='hide', fig.keep='none'}
library(dotwhisker)
library(palmerpenguins)

m1 <- lm(flipper_length_mm ~ bill_length_mm,
           data = penguins)
m2 <- lm(flipper_length_mm ~ bill_length_mm + sex,
           data = penguins)

dwplot(list(m1, m2),
       vline = geom_vline(xintercept = 0))
```

## Dumbbell and lollipop charts

The `ggcharts` package is for the lazy cats and gives access to a lot of common charts [@ggcharts]. The package has implemented graphs such as dumbbell and lollipop charts with its own functions, and we don't have to create each step on our own. 

For example, create a dumbbell or a lollipop chart. I used the former to examine how life expectancy increased between 1952 and 2007 based on the `gapminder` data. The example shows the top 10 European countries with the highest increase in life expectancy.

```{r Fig_734, echo=FALSE, eval=T, purl=FALSE}
dumbbell_plot()
```

```{r,  results='hide', fig.keep='none'}
#Minimal code example #####
library(ggcharts)
data("popeurope")

dumbbell_chart(popeurope, 
               x = country,
               y1 = pop1952, y2 = pop2007,
               top_n = 10)
```

## Hexbin map

Create a hexbin map with `ggplot2`. A hexbin map is a great way to visualize the density of data points in a geographical area. It may surprise you, there is no extension package needed. The `geom_polygon()` function creates the hexbin map and here it shows US unemployment rates.

```{r Fig_735, echo=FALSE, eval=F, purl=FALSE}
hexbin_plot()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE, fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics('plots/03/Fig_735.png')
```

The graph is inspired by [r-graph-gallery.com](www.r-graph-gallery.com) website. It shows a great variety of (`ggplot2`) visualization, provides a lot of resources to create plots, and has articles that discuss the limitations of graphs as well. Have you ever seen a radar, a stream, or a sunburst chart? Visit the website and learn how to make them.

```{r}
#Minimal code example #####
#There are many graphs (and code) to explore on:
#www.r-graph-gallery.com
```

## Mosaic plots

Mosaic (or spine) plots are a great way to visualize the relationship between two categorical variables. The area of each rectangle is proportional to the number of observations in each category. I used the `titanic` data to depict the effect of passenger's sex on survival. Obviously, more women than men survived the accident.

```{r Fig_736, echo=FALSE, eval=T, purl=FALSE}
mosaic_plot()
```

The `ggmosaic()` package provides the corresponding geom [@ggmosaic]. The package is a great tool to create mosaic plots and it is easy to use. The minimal code example shows how to create a mosaic plot with the `titanic` data. The product function is used to create a two-way table.

```{r,  results='hide', fig.keep='none'}
#Minimal code example #####
library(ggmosaic)

ggplot(data = titanic) +
  geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(Sex), 
                  fill = Survived))

```

## Ridge plots

A ridge plot is a great way to visualize the distribution of a numerical variable across different categories. The plot shows the density of the variable for each category. In the example plot, I used the `gapminder` data to visualize the distribution of life expectancy across different continents. Europe has the highest, while Africa had the lowest life expectancy. The distribution is much wider in Africa compared to other continents.





```{r Fig_737, echo=FALSE, eval=T, purl=FALSE}
ridge_plot()
```

The `ggridges` package was developed by @wilke_ggridges_2018 and provides many examples to create ridge plots [@ggridges]. The package creates a ridge plot and fills the area under the curve with a gradient color. As the code from the ggridges vignette illustrates, explore how the weather (temperature) changes over a year.

```{r, results='hide', fig.keep='none'}
#Minimal code example #####
library(ggridges)

#Minimal code by Claus Wilke:
ggplot(lincoln_weather, aes(x = `Mean Temperature [F]`, y = Month, 
                            fill = stat(x))) +
  geom_density_ridges_gradient(scale = 3, 
                               rel_min_height = 0.01) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = "Temp. [F]", 
                       option = "C") 
```

## Treemaps

A treemap is a great way to visualize hierarchical data. The area of each rectangle is proportional to the observed value. Before he was banned, Donald Trump was a huge fan of Twitter and Axios collected and categorized his tweets. Some tweets were about *the media*, *democrats*, and the grand old party (*GOP*), with further subgroups within each category. I used this data and the `treemapify` package to make a treemap [@treemapify]. Mr. Trump tweeted a lot about "the media" and the "Democrats" in 2019.

```{r Fig_738, echo=FALSE, eval=T, purl=FALSE}
tree_map()
#tree2()
```

In the example below I used the `gapminder` data to visualize the GDP per capita and life expectancy of European countries in 2007. The `treemapify` package provides the `geom_treemap()` function to create a treemap. The `geom_treemap_text()` function adds labels to the treemap.

```{r,  results='hide', fig.keep='none'}
#Minimal code example #####
library(treemapify)
library(gapminder)

data <- gapminder::gapminder |> 
  dplyr::filter(year == 2007 & continent == "Europe")

ggplot(data, aes(area = gdpPercap, 
                 fill = lifeExp, 
                 label = country)) +
  geom_treemap() +
  geom_treemap_text(color = "white", 
                    grow = TRUE)
```

## Waffle charts

An alternative for a pie chart is a waffle chart. The latter depicts values across different categories and the area of each rectangle is proportional to the observed value. In case of percentages, the area of each rectangle is proportional to the percentage value. My example shows the leaky pipeline in academia. Did you know that after each transition step in higher education (e.g., graduation, Ph.D.), more men than women remain in the system? The sex ratios become skewed till the end of the academic pathway. I used a waffle chart to illustrate the leaky pipeline for Germany in 2020.

```{r Fig_739, echo=FALSE, eval=T, purl=FALSE}
# fig.cap = "\\label{9}A waffle chart example"
waffle_plot()
```

The `waffle` package provides the `waffle()` function to create a waffle chart [@waffle]. The `rows` argument controls the number of rows in the chart. The minimal code shows how to create a waffle chart with a toy vector.


```{r, results='hide', fig.keep='none'}
#Minimal code example #####
library(waffle)
parts <- c(66, 22, 12)

waffle(parts, rows = 10)
```

## Word clouds

A word cloud shows the frequency of words in a text. The size of each word is proportional to its frequency. The plot shows the word cloud of a children's book that I made with the `ggwordcloud` package [@ggwordcloud]. Witches and wizards play a big role in this book.

```{r Fig_7310, echo=FALSE, eval=T, purl=FALSE}
wordle_plot()
#alice_plot()
```

The ggwordcloud package provides the `geom_text_wordcloud()` function to create a word cloud. The `size` argument controls the size of the words. The minimal code example shows how to create a word cloud with the `love_words_small` data.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Minimal code example by Erwan Le Pennec 
library(ggwordcloud)
#set a seed (starting point)
set.seed(123)

ggplot(love_words_small, aes(label = word, 
                             size = speakers)) +
  geom_text_wordcloud() +
  scale_size_area(max_size = 30)
```

## Summary

This blog highlighted packages to extend the possibilities of `ggplot2`, but there are too many to discuss them all. For example, `ggtext` helps to handle text [@ggtext]; you can visualize the results of a survival analysis with `survminer` [@survminer]; or create cool animations with `gganimate` [@gganimate].

Finally, go and visit the [ggplot2 website](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) to explore more extensions.
