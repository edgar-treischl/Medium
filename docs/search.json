    "text": "1.1 The R exams package\nAs university instructors, we are creating exams and we use often multiple-choice questions to assess the knowledge of our students. I don’t know how many times I have manually corrected an exam which is why this blog gives a short introduction and shows why you should consider the R exams package for single or multiple choice exams (Grün and Zeileis 2009). The package provides features to automate the entire process, from generating the exam up to assigning grades.\nFirst, why should you consider R for exams? The exams package helps you to generate, scan, and assess the exam. It helps you to create a scan sheet that your students fill out in the exam. After the exam, you can use a regular copy machine to scan the sheets. The exams package scans those images, assess students’ answers, and provides documents with the results instantly. That is an awesome reason. Furthermore, it helps you to reduce mistakes because students’ answers are no longer corrected manually and it returns a HTML file for each participant that shows the scan sheet, the given and the correct answers, and how many points the person has earned.\nIn order to use exams, we need to setup a folder that contains all the question of the exam, we need the images of the exam to extract the information and we have to assess the students’ answers. Give it a try and learn how each step works before you setup your own exam, because the exams package comes with a nice tutorial and all necessary demo files to create and scan an exam. The next subsections give a quick summary of the demonstration from the website, but you can find a step-by-step guide on the R exams website website as well."

    "section": "1.2 The demo from the R exams package",
    "text": "1.2 The demo from the R exams package\nBefore we can start to create the exam, we need exercises or exam questions and the package provides a list of exercises files that we can download on the website. Make a new folder where all the files will be stored. Copy the exercises from the website and save them in a new folder named exercises. Next, create a new R script, install and load the library.\n\n#install.packages(\"exams\")\nlibrary(exams)\n\nAs a first step, we need to decide which questions should be included in the exam. Therefore, we create a list that stores questions names. In the last section, we will see how to create our own questions, but as first step it is fine if we use the questions provided by the exams package. As the next output shows, I created a list (exercises_exam) with several example questions:\n\n#setup a list of (example) exam questions\nexercises_exam &lt;- list(\n  \"tstat2.Rnw\",\n  \"ttest.Rnw\",\n  \"relfreq.Rnw\",\n  \"anova.Rnw\",\n  c(\"boxplots.Rnw\", \"scatterplot.Rnw\"),\n  \"cholesky.Rnw\"\n)\n\nSecond, I use this list to create the exam with the help of the exams2nops() function. The latter creates a PDF file based on the exercises_exam list and adds the scan sheet as first page. As the exams package outlines, you may want to set a seed to reproduce the results and we assign the exam as test_exam.\n\n#Create a PDF for the exam\nset.seed(403)\ntest_exam &lt;- exams2nops(exercises_exam, \n                  dir = \"nops_pdf\", \n                  name = \"demo\", date = \"2015-07-29\",\n                  points = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3),\n                  n = 2)\n\nThere are several options how to adjust the exam and you may check the documentation to adjust the minimal code for your own purposes. As the minimal code shows, we need to provide the directory (dir) where the pdf will be stored (here: nops_pdf), a name and the date of the exam; and I created two different versions of the exam (with randomized order of the questions), but you can create more versions if you want to. In addition to the pdf files, the exams2nops() function saves a .rds file in the directory which contains all of the meta data about the exam (e.g. solutions). We will see where this information is coming from in the last section.\nThe package provides everything that is needed for a test run and includes also test exam images. The next code snippet saves two example scan files as scan_image. We can use the two files to see how we can evaluate images and scan an exam.\n\n#Use example images to check out how it works\nscan_image &lt;- dir(system.file(\"nops\", package = \"exams\"), \n           pattern = \"nops_scan\",\n           full.names = TRUE)\n\nAll of the scan images must be stored in one directory. Create a new directory with dir.create(\"nops_scan\") where the scan files will be saved and the second line of code copies the demo files scan_image into the nops_scan folder with file.copy().\n\n#Create a folder and copy images\ndir.create(\"nops_scan\")\nfile.copy(scan_image, to = \"nops_scan\")\n\nAfter you run this code chunk, two fake scan images appear in your folder, one from Ambi Dexter and another one from Jane Doe, as the next figure illustrates.\n\nAfter we have prepared all the essential steps, we use the nops_scan() function to scan the images. It trims and rotates the files and extracts the information from the PNG.\n\n#Scan images\nnops_scan(dir = \"nops_scan\")\n\nHave a look in your directory. The nops_scan() function saves the result as a archive, which includes the png files as well as a text file with the extracted information.\nBefore we can finally evaluate the results, we need a list with the information of our students to match them with the results of the exam. The minimal example gives you a code snippet to create a csv file that contains the information about the two fake students from the demo.\n\n#Who participates the exam? Load data or use example data \nwrite.table(data.frame(\n  registration = c(\"1501090\", \"9901071\"),\n  name = c(\"Jane Doe\", \"Ambi Dexter\"),\n  id = c(\"jane_doe\", \"ambi_dexter\")), \n  file = \"Exam-2015-07-29.csv\", sep = \";\", quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE)\n\nFinally, we can use the nops_eval() function to evaluate the scanned images. The register points to the students’ matching list, solutions points to the meta data of the exam, scans provides the directory and name of the scan results, eval determines how the results are evaluated (e.g. do we give partial points), and interactive gives information whether errors should be handled interactively or not. Check out the documentation of nops_eval() for more information.\n\n#Extract/Eval information from images\nexam_results &lt;- nops_eval(\n  register = \"Exam-2015-07-29.csv\",\n  solutions = \"nops_pdf/demo.rds\",\n  scans = Sys.glob(\"nops_scan/nops_scan_*.zip\"),\n  eval = exams_eval(partial = FALSE, negative = FALSE),\n  interactive = TRUE\n)\n\nAnyway, the nops_eval() returns a data frame that contains the answers, solutions, and given points for each student!\n\n#Inspect results\nexam_results\n\n\nCheckout your folder. The nops_eval() function has already exported the exam file and it created an archive that contains a short summary document of the exam results for each student. As the next figure shows, it displays the meta information of your students, an assessment of each question, and the image of the scan sheet used to extract the information. Thus, you are really prepared if your students show up to review the exam.\n\nThus, the exams package reduces a lot of pain when it comes to correct exams and I really hope, that I have convinced you that you can handle the discussed steps, even if you have limited experience using R. To boost the popularity of the package, and to convince you that you should stick to R for the next steps as well, the next section shows you how can use R to prepare the data and automate the process to communicate the exam results. Sure, you can use any software to finalize the data, but R gives you some nice features to automate this process and you can even use R to make a summary document for your students without much effort. Unfortunately, this implies that I assume in the next section that you have basic R knowledge."

    "section": "1.3 R is your exam friend",
    "text": "1.3 R is your exam friend\nHow do we communicate the results of the exam and how can we automate this process? The data is saved as nops_eval.csv and we can use R to wrangle the exam data, prepare a final list with the results (a list to enter grades in the educational system), and to communicate the exam results.\nObviously, the exam data is already loaded, but we have to import the data if we want to provide a short summary for the participants or if we want to rerun the data management steps. Thus, use the readr package to import the data and the tidyverse approach for data wrangling (Wickham et al. 2019). If you are not familiar with loading data in R, import the data with the import data function in RStudio. It gives you a preview of the data, shows you the corresponding packages and the code to import the data. As the following code snippet shows, you can read a delimited file (including csv & tsv) with the read_delim() function and we have to tweak the delimiters, because our file contains semicolons instead of commas to separate values.\n\n#Load data\nlibrary(readr)\nexam_df &lt;- read_delim(\"nops_eval.csv\", \n                        \";\", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)\n\nNext, I exclude all variables which are not longer necessary for the report after importing that data. The dplyr package gives a lot handy functions to work with data and the package is included in the tidyverse package (Wickham et al. 2023). We can use the select() function to make a narrow data frame with an ID variable (register number) and the points variable from the exam data only. I generated some fake data to illustrate this process, but the code shows you furthermore how you can save a new data frame with the selected variables:\n\n#Fake example data\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nexam_df &lt;- tribble(\n  ~ID, ~points,\n   1, 57,\n   2, 60,\n   3, 84,\n   4, 45,\n   5, 82\n)\n\nexam_df &lt;- exam_df  %&gt;% \n  select(ID, points)\nexam_df\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n     ID points\n  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     1     57\n2     2     60\n3     3     84\n4     4     45\n5     5     82\n\n\nAgain, the exam package makes our life very easy since there is not much to do which is why I try to encourage people to use R even if you have little experience using it. As the next code chunk illustrates, we have to generate a new variable that stores the grade depending on the points people have achieved. Use mutate() to extend the data frame and the case_when() function assigns grades in accordance to the points of the exam. I decided that grade level goes from 100 to 50 points with a range of 5 points for each grade level, but that is not the important point here. The case_when() function checks whether the condition (e.g. points &gt;= 95 ~ 1.0) is fulfilled and assigns the corresponding grade if that’s the case. Let’s see how it works:\n\n#Give grades according to points\nexam_df &lt;- exam_df %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    grade = (\n      case_when(\n        points &gt;= 95 ~ 1.0,\n        points &gt;= 90 ~ 1.3,\n        points &gt;= 85 ~ 1.7,\n        points &gt;= 80 ~ 2.0,\n        points &gt;= 75 ~ 2.3,\n        points &gt;= 70 ~ 2.7,\n        points &gt;= 65 ~ 3.0,\n        points &gt;= 60 ~ 3.3,\n        points &gt;= 55 ~ 3.7,\n        points &gt;= 50 ~ 4.0,\n        points &lt;= 49 ~ 5.0\n      )\n    )\n  )\n\nexam_df\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n     ID points grade\n  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     1     57   3.7\n2     2     60   3.3\n3     3     84   2  \n4     4     45   5  \n5     5     82   2  \n\n\nAs the output shows, Person 1 has 57 points and gets the grade 3.7 (German grading system); person 4 gets the grade 5 because he/she has achieved less than 50, and so on. Please check each grade level to make sure that there are no mistakes, no typos, or any other problems.\nThe next steps depend on how you have to enter the grades in your higher educational system. For instance, I need a sorted list and the grades multiplied by 100 at my university. Nothing easier than that, use mutate() again to extend our data frame with an additional grade and use arrange() to sort the data.\n\n#Arrange and check if data preparation steps really worked\nexam_df %&gt;% \n  mutate(grade_system = grade * 100) %&gt;%\n  arrange(ID)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 4\n     ID points grade grade_system\n  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     1     57   3.7          370\n2     2     60   3.3          330\n3     3     84   2            200\n4     4     45   5            500\n5     5     82   2            200\n\n\nFinally, I need to match the exam list with a list of students who have actually registered for the exam, but some did not show up in the exam. This step also depends on what your institution wants from you, which makes it hard for me to give you any useful advice. You may want to check out how to merge data (in my case I used a left_join()); after I merged the data, I save the final results with the readr package, for example, as a csv file.\n\n#In case you need to save your results\nwrite_csv(final_results, \"final_results.csv\")\n\nThus, you can create, scan and correct exams even if you have only limited knowledge about R, but I know from my own experience that the start can be tricky and we all need sometimes an incentive.\nI guess reducing mistakes when correct exams is already an huge incentive, but you can also use R to generate a small report for your students. You may want to check out rmarkdown which let you easily create different files (pdf, html, word) and I have a standard document for my students that contains a table as well as a histogram that depicts the exam grades (Allaire et al. 2023). The next console shows the code to generate such a histogram with the help of the ggplot2 package (Wickham 2016).\n\n#Inspect the results visually\nmean_grade &lt;- exam_df %&gt;% \n  pull(grade) %&gt;% \n  mean() %&gt;% \n  round(2)\n\n#Plot it\nggplot(exam_df, aes(x=grade)) +\n  geom_histogram(colour=\"black\", fill=\"white\", bins = 11)+\n  geom_vline(xintercept=mean_grade, size=1.5, color=\"red\")+\n  geom_text(aes(x=mean_grade+0.5, label=paste0(\"Mean\\n\",mean_grade), y=8))+\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)\n\n\n\n\nThe ggplot2 package, rmarkdown, r-exam, maybe you feel a lit bit overwhelmed depending on your background. I just wanted to outline the advantages if we create all steps in the same environment, and R gives you the possibilities to do all essential steps when it comes to exams. Moreover, it is very easy to learn rmarkdown or ggplot2 in case you have never heard of it before. I hope that the code examples give you a start how to apply it on your own. You could even have my own RMarkdown template, but RStudio comes with several rmarkdown templates and if you copy the code from above, you have essentially the same as I use.\nFrom my opinion there is only one thing left for me to do. You have to create your own exercises before you can think of using R for your exams."

In this section you have to outline whether you use a single (schoice) or multiple choice (mchoice); exsolution points to the binary string code for the solutions, here A and C are right which leads to 1010. Ultimately, you can decide whether the answers of the questions is shuffled or not.\nThe R exams package has much more to offer than I could possibly show you. I just tried to give a quick summary how R can be used for exams. Visit the R exams website for tutorials, the dynamic exercises, or e-learning tests.

    "section": "2.1 Run SQL queries from R",
    "text": "2.1 Run SQL queries from R\nMany books and courses introduces SQL and they outline in depth what SQL (structured query language) is. A lot of them go beyond this step, they start to introduce different databases backends (e.g., MySQL, MariaDB), CLI commands to interact with databases, and they show how to setup software or at least introduce a web interface to interact with a database.\nCertainly, these topics increase our understanding, but this seems a lot of effort considering your first goal is to familiarize yourself with SQL. We need to practice SQL and the described steps make the learning curve pretty steep. Fortunately, for R users there is no need to install software or create a database to run your first queries. Consider the next console with a simple SQL code snippet. It illustrates that we often start with a select step since we need to retrieve data from the database. We select one, several, or all columns (*) from the table. Later I’ll show you that we can use R and translate R code into SQL, so keep this simple SQL snippet in mind:\n\n--Example SQL Code\nSELECT var FROM data;\n\nIn further steps we may learn how to filter the data and set a condition (in SQL we apply a WHERE clause); we learn how to count (COUNT) cases, or do some basic calculations such as calculating the mean (AVG). You can write and run all of these queries without leaving R. Let’s keep it simple. Suppose we want to learn how to select a variable and calculate the mean:\n\nSELECT AVG(var) FROM data;\n\nThe sqldf package let us apply SQL code snippets to a data frame (Grothendieck 2017). You can build your SQL skills and follow a course without a large setup, without our own database, or any cloud solution in the beginning. Install the package (via install.packages) and write your first queries from R. How about the mean consumption of cars with the implemented mtcars data:\n\n#Run SQL code from R\nlibrary(sqldf)\nsqldf('SELECT AVG(mpg) FROM mtcars;')\n\n#&gt;   AVG(mpg)\n#&gt; 1 20.09062\n\n\nThe sqldf package makes it very convenient to run a few SQL snippets and the package outlines how we interact with different SQL databases in its documentation: ” sqldf() transparently sets up a database, imports the data frames into that database, performs the SQL select or other statement and returns the result using a heuristic to determine which class to assign to each column of the returned data frame” (Grothendieck 2017).\nAgain, there is no need to establish a real database in the beginning, we can make use of the local memory to simulate a database, save a table (data frame) and run SQL commands directly as a code chunk from the R script exactly as the sqldf package does. The RSQLite package helps us with this task, it creates the SQLite database on your local machine (Müller et al. 2023). With this approach, it is almost like if we work with a real database, but it is still very convenient for beginners. To do so, we need to establish a connection to the database and this code chunk will also work as a template in the near future when you switch from the local to the real database.\nHow do we connect R with a database? Use the DBI package to connect to many different databases (Wickham and Müller 2022). In a nutshell, we need to establish a connection (con) with the dbConnect() function. This implies that we need to pick a driver (drv) to connect to a specific database (e.g., RMariaDB::MariaDB() for MariaDB; or RSQLServer::SQLServer for Postgres, etc.); furthermore, we need to provide the properties needed to get access to the database (e.g., host, username, etc.).\nThe DBI package gives us the code to illustrate this step with a guest account for a MariaDB database.\n\n#Establish a connection\nlibrary(DBI)\n\ncon &lt;- dbConnect(\n  drv = RMariaDB::MariaDB(),\n  dbname = \"sakila\",\n  host = \"relational.fit.cvut.cz\",\n  port = 3306,\n  username = \"guest\",\n  password = \"relational\"\n)\n\nAfter we made the connection, check if the approach worked. The dbListTables() functions lists all available tables of the connected database.\n\n#List all available tables/data\ndbListTables(con)\n#  [1] \"actor\"         \"address\"       \"category\"     \n#  [4] \"city\"          \"country\"       \"customer\"     \n#  [7] \"film\"          \"film_actor\"    \"film_category\"\n# [10] \"film_text\"     \"inventory\"     \"language\"     \n# [13] \"payment\"       \"rental\"        \"staff\"        \n# [16] \"store\"     \n\nKeep in mind that we do not want to share sensitive information such as the user name or password in the code. Use the askForPassword() function from the rstudioapi package (Ushey et al. 2023). It forces us to insert the password each time we connect. Or use the keyring package to save the key savely in your environment and not in the code (Csárdi 2022). Irrespective of the used approach, we connect to the database, retrieve and wrangle data, and finally disconnect before we can go on.\n\n#Disconnect after have finished the job\ndbDisconnect(con)\n\nI claimed that we can run this step without having access to a database. That’s where the RSQLite package comes into play. The SQLite() function creates the SQLite database on your local machine if you use :memory: as database name (dbname).\n\n# Create in-memory RSQLite database\ncon &lt;- dbConnect(drv = RSQLite::SQLite(), \n                 dbname = \":memory:\")\n\nThis creates an empty database which is why we need to insert a table into the local database first.\n\n#Write a table into the data base\ndbWriteTable(conn = con, \n             name = \"mtcars\", \n             value = mtcars)\n\nThe dbSendQuery() function let you sent SQL queries to the connected database, dbFetch shows the result, and we can clear the result after we have finished.\n\n#Send queries to the local database\nresult_DB &lt;- dbSendQuery(con, \"SELECT AVG(mpg) FROM mtcars;\")\ndbFetch(result_DB)\n\n#&gt;   AVG(mpg)\n#&gt; 1 20.09062\n\ndbClearResult(result_DB)\n\nSuch R packages increases our learning curve substantially, since we can create a database and write SQL code without any other equipment than our local machine. In addition, the dbplyr package will help us to combine our R skills with SQL, it even translate R into SQL."

It allows you to use remote database tables as if they are in-memory data frames by automatically converting dplyr code into SQL.” Thus, we can apply common dplyr verbs to SQL databases.

Suppose we didn’t know how to select and calculate the mean in SQL. There are several ways to calculate it with R, but the tidyverse approach is not difficult (Wickham et al. 2019); and it let us apply our dplyr knowledge thanks to the dbplyr package. The summarise() function collapses the data and we get the mean() by including it in the latter step, however, only if we run the code locally.\n\n#Get mean with dplyr (locally)\nmtcars |&gt; \n  summarise(mean_mpg = mean(mpg))\n\n#&gt;   mean_mpg\n#&gt; 1 20.09062\n\n\nIn order to apply this step in our database, we must assign the data manipulation steps (here as summary) and we must execute the query to retrieve results via the collect() function.\n\n#Get mean with dbplyr\nsummary &lt;- mtcars_db |&gt; \n  summarise(mean_mpg = mean(mpg))\n\n#Collect (execute and retrieve) the result from the db\nsummary |&gt;  collect()\n\n#&gt; # A tibble: 1 × 1\n#&gt;   mean_mpg\n#&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n#&gt; 1     20.1\n\n\nWhat is happening under the hood? How can we apply R code to SQL? The package has a show_query() function which shows the underlying SQL code that we sent to the database.\n\n#Inspect SQL query\nsummary |&gt;  show_query()\n\n#&gt; &lt;SQL&gt;\n#&gt; SELECT AVG(`mpg`) AS `mean_mpg`\n#&gt; FROM `mtcars`\n\n\nThe packages has more to offer than I possibly can outline. For example, translate_sql() let you translate SQL code. This may help with your learning curve and it also highlights that there are different SQL dialects depending on the database you work with. Suppose to need to clean data. How can we manipulate strings to lower case in SQL? In R we may use the tolower() function:\n\n#tolower returns strings in lower case\ntolower(\"HeLLo WoRld\")\n\n#&gt; [1] \"hello world\"\n\n\nThe translate_sql() function translate it to SQL and we can see differences between SQL dialects such as SQLite and Access (LOWER and LCASE) if we simulate different engines (e.g., simulate_sqlite).\n\n#Translate with different SQL engines\ntranslate_sql(tolower(\"HeLLo WoRld\"), con = simulate_sqlite())\n\n#&gt; &lt;SQL&gt; LOWER('HeLLo WoRld')\n\ntranslate_sql(tolower(\"HeLLo WoRld\"), con = simulate_access())\n\n#&gt; &lt;SQL&gt; LCASE('HeLLo WoRld')\n\n\nGo the website to learn more about dbplyr; however, I have one last one last advice for the road."

    "text": "2.3 Document SQL with Rmarkdown and Quarto\nIf I do not work with a language on a regular base, I forget how it works instantly. Thus, code documentation is an important issue. In R we create documents with rmarkdown, but we can also include different languages - including SQL - in an rmarkdown or a Quarto document. Go the rmarkdown website if have never created documents with R, because we can create a document with text, (SQL) code, and the output to summarize what you have achieved so far. Moreover, you can be sure that the code contains no mistake since the code runs when the document is created.\nSay we want to document the SQL code from the beginning:\n\n--Example SQL Code\nSELECT AVG(mpg) FROM mtcars;\n\n\n1 records\n\n\nAVG(mpg)\n\n\n\n\n20.09062\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, you need to create the connection to the database. Create a new rmarkdown document and insert the code to create a connection inside the setup-chunk. Second, insert a code chunk into the document, but this time a SQL code chunk and point to the database via the connection chunk-option. This makes it possible to run the SQL code and it returns the output as result. The next code shows how such code chunk looks like in an R Markdown document:\n\n\n```{sql connection=con}\n--Example SQL Code\nSELECT AVG(mpg) FROM mtcars;\n```\n\n\nI hope you find the discussed tips helpful, at least, I missed them when I started to learn SQL.\n\n\n\n\nCsárdi, Gábor. 2022. “Keyring: Access the System Credential Store from r.” https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=keyring.\n\n\nGrothendieck, G. 2017. “Sqldf: Manipulate r Data Frames Using SQL.” https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sqldf.\n\n\nMüller, Kirill, Hadley Wickham, David A.
